# intellji-github-theme
An exact replica of github's syntax highlighting (or as close as you can get) for PHP, Python, HTML, LESS, CSS, Java, Blade, Javascript. I created this as I couldn't find a colour scheme on the web that had multiple languages and was styled *exactly* like Github (2016).

## Requirements
- Intellji 14.2+
- If you want the true experience, install Microsoft Office to get the `Consolas` font which is used.

## Installation
- `Import -> Settings -> settings.jar`
